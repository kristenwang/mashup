# Mashup project

This project is open-ended! Requirements:

* Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting, interactive way.
* Replace this README with a description of the project.

The webpage is the simple version of my personal homepage.
And I added API from Spotify to play an album named "Hope" from The Strumbellas.
The whole album could be played on the webpage, and each name of the song could be clicked to listen to them in Spotify separately.
